<h1 align="center">Minute Timer Widget</h1>

This is a widget that allows you to quickly start a timer in just 2-3 touches. Value input is similar to the standard timer, that is, using a dial. The difference is:

* the timer is launched from the home screen
* skips the input of seconds (since we don't need them in 90 per cent of cases).

Thanks to these two differences, the minimum time for starting the timer is achieved. This app does not count the time, but simply delegates the work to a capable application using intent action [ACTION_SET_TIMER](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#CreateTimer)
